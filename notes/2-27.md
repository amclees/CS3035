# More Object Features
### Agenda
1. Objects

## Lecture

#### JSON
* JSON is a way of representing data
* It uses dumbed down syntax for JS Objects
* Convert to and from via JSON.stringify and JSON.parse

#### `this`
* `this` is a keyword that refers to the parent object
* `this` can be passed in by calling `function.bind(newThis, args)`
* `bind` then gives a new function with `this` properly bound

### Making Objects
* `Object.create` makes a new object from a prototype
* Constructors are functions where you use `new`, and it is bound to the new object

### Table Example
* The example combines objects, prototypes, and higher-order function
