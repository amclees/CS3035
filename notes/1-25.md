### Lecture
#### Review of previous lecture
#### JavaScript Syntax
* JavaScript provides `Infinity` and `-Infinity` for use in math. It does not have certain operations such as subtraction defined on it.
* `NaN` is Not a Number; it is returned when operations are not defined
* Strings have `\t` and `\n`, tab and newline respectively
* To escape these, add an extra slash
* Comparators work on characters
* `typeof` gives type of an expression
* Order of precedence: (), !, comparison, &&, ||
* `===` is verification of type and value equality
* Ternary operator defined as in Java, `A ? B : C`
* `null` and `undefined` both lack meaningful values
```javascript
typeof null        // "object" (not "null" for legacy reasons)
typeof undefined   // "undefined"
null === undefined // false
null  == undefined // true
null === null //true
null == null //true
!null //true
isNaN(1 + null) //false
isNaN(1 + undefined) //true
```
* `null` is an `object`. `undefined` is an `undefined`. Thus, they do not `===` each other but do standard equal.
* Both `null` and `undefined` are casted as `0` for `*`, `-`, `+`, `/` and `false` for `==`
* Both `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting
* JavaScript variables are same as Java variables in passing
* `var` makes a variable non-global, drops it into proper scope
```javascript
a = 2;
b = 3;
var c = 12;
if(a !== b) {
  var c = 20;
  console.log(c);
}
console.log(c);
```
* The above code will output
```
20
20
```
* This is because the `var` keyword puts to variable into the local scope. `if` statement scope is the same as the rest of the code. Notably excluding `var` often puts the variable in the global scope.
* To add a script to an HTML page, create a script object, add a function to it, append it to the body, and invoke it
