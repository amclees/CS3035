#4th Class - JavaScript Objects and Arrays
###Agenda
1. Arrays
2. Objects

##Lecture
* Reviewed lab assignment from last week
###Arrays
* Written as `[]` with no size declaration
* May store a variety of different types, though arrays with only numbers use quicksort
* Arrays are objects
###Objects
* Unordered collection of properties
* Custom methods needed for deep comparison
####Properties
* Properties seperated by `,`
* Properties written as `A : B,`
* No `,` after the last property
* Properties may be accessed as `object[name-of-property]` or `object.name-of-property`
* Note that a string used as a property name can be accessed either way if it is a valid variable name
* The array access can be more useful for invalid property names, such as an arrays as a property name
```javascript
var bicycle = {
  speed: 5.7,
  name: "Best Bike",
  increaseSpeed: function(amount) {
    this.speed += amount;
  }
};
bicycle.self = bicycle;
bicycle.speed = 20;
bicycle.increaseSpeed(bicycle.speed);
```
* In the above example, `speed` will have a final value of `40`
* The above example also shows `this` can be used as a reference to the local object
* `delete` drops a property
####Methods
* A method is a function stored as a property
* `increaseSpeed` is a method of `bicycle` in the above example
* Array has the `push` and `pop` methods like a **stack**
* `slice(start, end)`is a subarray method for arrays
* `concat(array)` adds two arrays together
####Strings
* Strings are not objects
* Strings are immutable (since they are not objects)
* Strings are stored directly (not referenced)
* Strings have `slice`, `indexOf`, `trim`, `charAt` 
```javascript
var string = "       This is the best string.   ";
var sliced = string.slice(0, 3); //Gets letters 1-4
var bestLocation = string.indexOf("best"); //Gets start of word best
var trimmed = string.trim(); //Cuts whitespace from edges
var theChar = string.charAt(3); //Grabs fourth letter which is " "
```
####`arguments` (The Object)
* The arguments object is an array of the arguments passed into the function
* It is automatically put into the scope of any function called
####Sidenote
An anagram game may be sped up if each word is put in alphabetical order.
