# Targeted Automated Testing using Constraint Logic Programming and Javascript Objects Continued


## Lecture
1. CLP Presentation
2. More on JS objects

### CLP Presentation
#### Explanation of the title
* Creates tests automatically with a language based on Prolog
* Tests target specific features

#### Benefits
* Faster
* Finds specific bugs not found by other systems and within existing testers

#### Approach
* Find bugs automatically
* No source code available, applied to running code
* No existing tests, create a new test suite because old tests may not be sufficient and can be harder to adapt to
* Some understanding of valid inputs because the goal of the system is understood
* Generating the inputs is the main problem, then they will be run
* This research covers the generation and application of the inputs to a single system
* Generating well-typed programs do not serve as good tests without further expansion into their targeting towards problems
* Can define a function of a potential input `isWellTyped`
* Can also define a function `goodCompilerTest`, `goodGCTest`, etc.

#### Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)
* Based on prolog
* Allows setting logical mathematical expressions within a programming language
```
inBounds(Min, E, Max) :-
  Min #=< E,
  E #=< Max.
```
* Above code may be fed into a CLP engine which will generate values that are in bounds
```
tree(leaf(E), Min, Max) :-
  inBounds(Min, E, Max).
tree(node(Left, E, Right),
      Min, Max) :-
      inBounds(Min, E, Max)
      ...
```
* Tree may then be given a min and max, and the CLP engine will generate values that satisfy it
* Using these conditions, test input generation becomes trivial given rules
* CLP engine meets conditions for various applications

### JS Object Lecture
* Table example review
