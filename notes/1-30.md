#3rd Class - JavaScript Control Flow

###Agenda
1. Control Flow
2. Functions if time allows

##Lecture
###Control Flow
* Control flow includes loops, if statements, switches, etc.
* Straight Control Flow - uses none of above
* Conditional blocks (``if`` statements) are the same syntax as Java
```javascript
if(5 + 7 < 100) {
  //Run some code
} else if(foo) {
  x++;
} else {
  x--;
}
```
* It is also possible to apply a single line ``if``
```javascript
if(foo) bar++;
```
* ``while`` loops have the same syntax as Java
```javascript
var drinks = 100;
while(drinks > 0) {
  drinks -= 1;
}
```
* ``do`` ``while`` loops are also implemented in JS
```javascript
do {
  var stop = confirm("Stop?");
} while(!stop);
```
* ``do`` ``while`` loops have the same syntax as Java
* ``for`` loops are also used like Java, but you can leave the statements inside empty if you leave the semicolons
```javascript
for(var foo = 0; foo < 100; foo++) {
  console.log(foo);
}
```
* `break` and `continue` are standalone statements used exactly like Java
* Labels not present like Java, so you need a special flag to break out loops implemented yourself
```javascript
while(cond1) {
  if(stop === true) break;
  while(cond2) {
    var stop = true;
    break;
  }
}
```
* ``switch`` works exactly like Java's switch
* `*=`, `+=`, `/=`, `-=`, `%=`, `++`, `--` are all defined as they are in Java
* Comments are same as Java
```javascript
conso/*Comment*/le.log("Logged"); //Invalid Statement
/* Comment */ console.log("Logged"); //Valid Statement
```
###Functions
* Use camel casing for function names
####Declaring Functions
* Two main ways to declare functions
* Declaration (like Java)
```javascript
function addUp(a, b) {
  return a	+ b;
}
```
* Anonymous (variable stored) function
```javascript
var addUp = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
* Both examples may be called in the same way
* You can also override functions with the declarative method
* Do not use the declarative inside loop/`if`
* Declarative may be defined anywhere then used anywhere
####Function Usage
* Variables inside a function are stored in the function's local scope if used with a `var` keyword
* Functions may be nested inside other functions
* Functions are a standard variable, so they may be passed around, called, reassigned, and use their return value straight in an expression
####Let
* `let` allows you to localize a variable for any block
```javascript
var x = 7;
if(true) {
  let x = 5;
}
console.log(x);
// -> 7
```
####Closures
* Values from the local scope are **inherited** by child scopes
* These inherited values may be passed to outside scopes
* JS will automatically resolve these inherited values by keeping them after the scope even if they would normally be cleared from memory
* This particularly applies to returning anonymous functions based on arguments being removed
* Worrying about it is not hugely necessary, but it is important because the values are grabbed via callbacks (in asynchronous environments this is important)
* Keep in mind that when doing this, passing a function around will have values frozen via callbacks (the function will not reference the same value as other functions)
####Function Notes on Use
* Functions can be called for their return value or side effect
* Pure functional programming has no side effects
