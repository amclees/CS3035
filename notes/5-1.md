# More Logic Programming

### Unification
* Two terms unify if they are the same or can be made the same by using rules
* There are 3 cases in which they unify
  1. They are the same atom
  2. One is a variable
  3. Commplex terms
    * Terms have same arity
    * Corresponding terms unify
    * Terms are applied consistently
* For complex terms, it is recursive


### Recursion
* Prolog will keep attempting DF to prove a statement
* Operators are short-circuiting (Contrary would be odd in a logic programming language)
*
