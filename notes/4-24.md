# Introduction to Logic Programming with Prolog

### Logic Programming

* Declare what is desired rather than the path to reach it
* Use a set of rules to which the program will conform

### Components

* Facts are `true` values
* Rules are conditional statements i.e. `p -> q`

### Prolog

* Prolog automatically initializes variables (basic ones are atoms, with not special properties)
* It ends statements in `.`
* It has facts:

```
isBlue(ocean).
isGreen(ocean).
isBlue(starfish).
isAlive(starfish).

```
