(3>5)&&(false)

var x = 10;

5%4 > 3 || false

Take a screen shot of your entry and the results.

#### Problem 2 (1pt):

Write a JavaScript script, name it "script.js". (Do not name it anything else, or you will lose the point). In the script write code to open an alert, a prompt, and a confirm. Store the return value of prompt and confirm into variables p and c. Console log the values in p and c.

Upload your script here.

#### Problem 3 (1pt):
